# BMI_Classifier_Model
## Overview
The BMI Classifier Web App is a Flask-based web application that predicts a person's BMI (Body Mass Index) classification based on their age, height, and weight. The app uses a trained Random Forest Classifier model and provides an interactive, user-friendly interface for input and result display.

## Features
Predict BMI Class: Determines the BMI classification (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight) based on user-provided inputs.

Machine Learning Integration: Implements a Random Forest Classifier trained on a BMI dataset.

Interactive Web Interface: Simple and clean design using HTML and CSS.

Local Deployment: Lightweight application that runs on a local server.

## Tech Stack
Software: Pycharm

Frontend: HTML,CSS

Backend: Python (Flask)

Machine Learning: scikit-learn

Dataset: CSV-based BMI dataset

## Usage
Enter your Age, Height (in meters), and Weight (in kilograms) into the form fields.

Click on the Predict BMI Class button.

View the BMI classification result displayed on the screen.

##  Future Enhancements
Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Azure).

Add detailed BMI categories (e.g., Obese Class I, II, III).

Include graphs to visualize BMI trends and classifications.

Implement an API for BMI predictions.
